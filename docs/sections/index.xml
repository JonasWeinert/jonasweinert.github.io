      <description>Welcome to my website. I am an Predoc with STICERD at the LSE, working with Robin Burgess and Oriana Bandiera. I am interested in political economy and development economics, and have previously worked on conflict and political reservations in India, democratic transitions and state repression, and longevity.
I plan to start a PhD in Economics in Fall 2021.
